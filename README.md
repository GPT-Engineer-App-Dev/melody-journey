# melody-journey

Implement a stylish landing page for a band's touring website, with the following features:
- Interactive header with a placeholder for band imagery 
- "About the Band" section with lorem ipsum placeholder text
- "Upcoming Tour Dates" section with a placeholder message like "Tour dates coming soon!"
- Mailing list signup form
- Social media links (just using the social media logos, no need to link anywhere yet)
Use "The Band" as a placeholder name for now. Make the design visually impactful and exciting to build anticipation for the tour!
