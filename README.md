# melody-journey

Implement a stylish landing page for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' touring website, with the following features:
- Interactive header with RHCP imagery and logo 
- "Upcoming Tour Dates" section (leave the actual dates blank for now)
- Embedded YouTube video of a popular RHCP music video 
- Links to the band's social media profiles
- A short "About the Band" blurb
- Mailing list signup form
Use a visually striking design with bold colors that match RHCP's aesthetic. The page should be impressive and build excitement for the upcoming tour.
